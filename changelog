Proton-5.5-GE-1

GloriousEggroll released this Apr 5, 2020

So I'd like to preface that this is a pre-release that has a massive amount of media foundation/mfplat wine patches. A huge thank you goes to Derek Lesho (Guy1524: https://github.com/Guy1524/wine) as well as Nikolay Sivov and Sergio GÃ³mez Del Real all from CodeWeavers for getting this stuff working and taking the time to help me get it working with the correct dependencies in proton.

What this does is allows mp4 playback in MANY titles, including UE4 -and- Unity engine games. This fixes a lot (not all, but a lot) of issues surrounding media foundation/mfplat without the need for the 'mf-install' workaround that has legal issues and limitations, and is much safer for us to ship.

Tested fixes:
-Fixed borderlands 3 lilith in-head videos and 'watch the monitor' video bug
-Fixes Remnant: From the Ashes intro videos, intro menu, character menu
-Fixes intro video on Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night
-Fixes mp4 playback issues related to Crazy Machines 3

Still broken:
-Borderlands 3 intro narrative with Marcus's voice on new game does not play
-Spyro is still broken
-Probably some other mp4 related titles

Additional updates:
-A small patch has been added that should fix sunset overdrive from crashing on launch: https://source.winehq.org/patches/data/182631
-Two warframe launcher regressions have been fixed
-Mouse input fix patches which were added to wine-staging for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36873
-Lots of gstreamer plugin related work has been done/added in order to get media foundation stuff working. This was also cleared with aeikum and kisak from Valve personally, and deemed -ok- to include in my repository. This means it is safe to continue to link in Valve's issue trackers, unlike the 'mf-install' workaround. HURRAY!

Additional notes:
-Not -all- mp4s are fixed. There are still some that have problematic formats that are being worked on.
-Also coming down the pipe soon will be WMV playback fixes. This is to be handled after the mp4 issues are sorted.

Enjoy!


Proton-5.4-GE-3

GloriousEggroll released this Mar 25, 2020

-wine 5.4 updated to latest git which includes some fixes/updates winevulkan to 1.2.134. DOOM Eternal seems to work fine with it when not blocked by Denuvo.
-Added ValveSoftware/wine#86 for more winevulkan compatibility
-Added https://source.winehq.org/patches/data/181826 for more winevulkan compatibility
-FAudio reverted to 20.03 stable release as some audio issues were reported
-Warframe controller patch updated to strictly only take effect when warframe is running, since the issue doesn't seem to affect other games.
-proton controller patches have been disabled (again) in favor of standard wine+wine-staging's, after reports of 'ghost' input and/or periodic input loss. SDL patches are still in applied.


Proton-5.4-GE-2

GloriousEggroll released this Mar 22, 2020

This is more of a clean-up release although some new stuff/fixes have been added, mainly for DOOM Eternal

-Updated wine + staging to 5.4-git/upstream for DOOM Eternal
-Added ValveSoftware/wine#85 VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2 and fake support for VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive for DOOM Eternal
-Added ValveSoftware/wine#83 which fixes some crashes in DARK SOULS III (374320), Nier: Automata (524220), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (814380)
-Added some missing registry entries that prevented Batman: Arkham Knight from starting on a clean prefix
-Cleaned up/removed unused mf_install verb in protonfixes in preparation for newer mfplat alpha patches (coming soon)
-Removed '-wolcen lords of mayhem 'blob head' fix' as the game devs fixed it internally per update 1.0.10.0
-Removed 'plasma systray fix' as it didn't really benefit anything, and actually interfered with some games.
-Removed Detroit:Become Human patch as it's already been upstreamed
-Cleaned up some duplicate patches and updated our current patches to work with latest wine-git+staging/git
-Updated vkd3d
-Updated dxvk
-Updated FAudio

Notes on DOOM Eternal:

    DOOM Eternal currently requires vulkan-loader/vulkan-icd-loader 1.2.135
    For AMD also requires mesa-git .
    ACO did not work for me with DOOM Eternal when I tried it, but llvm worked fine.
    To get rid of pre-launch GPU notices such as (HDR not supported), open DOOMEternal/launcherData/launcher.cfg and change all of these to 0:

rgl_showAMDStartupWarning 0
rgl_showIntelStartupWarning 0
rgl_showNvidiaStartupWarning 0

This is a pre-release to fix the Warframe Launcher bug introduced in 2/18's update.


Proton-5.1-GE-2

GloriousEggroll released this Feb 17, 2020

This is mainly a hotfix + feature release build.

Hotfix:
-Fixed warframe requiring a controller to be plugged in. That's right, you no longer need xboxdrv! I spent the weekend debugging it and was finally able to come up with a bit of a hacky workaround, but it works for now until valve addresses the issue (it has to do with the way lsteamclient handles controllers)

Feature:
-vkd3d branch is latest from codeweavers + DXIL changes by Hans Kristian (who has been doing a lot of vkd3d submissions) + metro exodus commits that both Hans and Doitsujin (creator of dxvk) have been working on together. The previous release had Hans's DXIL changes, this just adds the Metro changes on top of it. With that being said, expect some minor graphical glitches in vkd3d with Metro Exodus

Additions:
-This commit: ValveSoftware#3518 has been merged. This was a previous open PR from Guy1542, but it had a bug that would cause clustertruck and a few others not to launch. The new PR is by joshie (d9vk dev) and works now

-dxvk update to latest git
-faudio updated to latest git

Known issues:
-Just Cause 3 not able to save
-Batman Arkham Knight grappling hook not working
-MK11 hanging at launch (again)
