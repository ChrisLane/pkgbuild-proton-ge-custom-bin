Proton-5.4-GE-3

GloriousEggroll released this Mar 25, 2020

Proton-5.4-GE-2

GloriousEggroll released this Mar 22, 2020

This is more of a clean-up release although some new stuff/fixes have been added, mainly for DOOM Eternal

-Updated wine + staging to 5.4-git/upstream for DOOM Eternal
-Added ValveSoftware/wine#85 VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2 and fake support for VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive for DOOM Eternal
-Added ValveSoftware/wine#83 which fixes some crashes in DARK SOULS III (374320), Nier: Automata (524220), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (814380)
-Added some missing registry entries that prevented Batman: Arkham Knight from starting on a clean prefix
-Cleaned up/removed unused mf_install verb in protonfixes in preparation for newer mfplat alpha patches (coming soon)
-Removed '-wolcen lords of mayhem 'blob head' fix' as the game devs fixed it internally per update 1.0.10.0
-Removed 'plasma systray fix' as it didn't really benefit anything, and actually interfered with some games.
-Removed Detroit:Become Human patch as it's already been upstreamed
-Cleaned up some duplicate patches and updated our current patches to work with latest wine-git+staging/git
-Updated vkd3d
-Updated dxvk
-Updated FAudio

Notes on DOOM Eternal:

    DOOM Eternal currently requires vulkan-loader/vulkan-icd-loader 1.2.135
    For AMD also requires mesa-git .
    ACO did not work for me with DOOM Eternal when I tried it, but llvm worked fine.
    To get rid of pre-launch GPU notices such as (HDR not supported), open DOOMEternal/launcherData/launcher.cfg and change all of these to 0:

rgl_showAMDStartupWarning 0
rgl_showIntelStartupWarning 0
rgl_showNvidiaStartupWarning 0

Proton-5.1-GE-2

GloriousEggroll released this Feb 17, 2020

This is mainly a hotfix + feature release build.

Hotfix:
-Fixed warframe requiring a controller to be plugged in. That's right, you no longer need xboxdrv! I spent the weekend debugging it and was finally able to come up with a bit of a hacky workaround, but it works for now until valve addresses the issue (it has to do with the way lsteamclient handles controllers)

Feature:
-vkd3d branch is latest from codeweavers + DXIL changes by Hans Kristian (who has been doing a lot of vkd3d submissions) + metro exodus commits that both Hans and Doitsujin (creator of dxvk) have been working on together. The previous release had Hans's DXIL changes, this just adds the Metro changes on top of it. With that being said, expect some minor graphical glitches in vkd3d with Metro Exodus

Additions:
-This commit: ValveSoftware#3518 has been merged. This was a previous open PR from Guy1542, but it had a bug that would cause clustertruck and a few others not to launch. The new PR is by joshie (d9vk dev) and works now

-dxvk update to latest git
-faudio updated to latest git

Known issues:
-Just Cause 3 not able to save
-Batman Arkham Knight grappling hook not working
-MK11 hanging at launch (again)
