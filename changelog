Proton-6.5-GE-1 Released

@GloriousEggroll GloriousEggroll released this 9 hours ago

This release is mainly a big cleanup of the mfplat stuff that was broken and should get most of the things working which were working before in addition to a few new fixes:

-Darksiders Warmastered Edition hangs at thq nordiq intro logo
-Grandia/Grandia II HD Remaster still crash on opening.

Proton-6.4-GE-1

Thanks everyone for being patient with this one. There's still some media foundation related bugs and pending fixes that Derek (mfplat patchset author) is working on, but this release should be good enough to get some new games working that weren't previously (notably MK11, Injustice 2, Need for Speed), At the end of the week wine 6.5 releases so if the media foundation patches are fully resolved by then there will likely be another release. Here are the details on this release for now:
Media Foundation changes/currently known issues:

Working:
-MK11 cutscenes fully working, video+audio in cutscenes works, has slight audio desync. Crypt also works.
-Injustice 2 cutscenes fully working, video+audio in cutscenes works, has slight audio desync

Broken:
-DmC 5's "History of DMC" video is broken again
-Power Rangers Battle for the Grid Story videos broken
-Seven: Days Long Gone Humble Bundle logo video will hang if intros are not skipped
-Borderlands 3 Marcus intro on new game hangs (again)
-RE2/RE3 WMV playback currently broken
Notes:
-As this is a new implementation of the mfplat patches, WMV support and MPEG4 Section 2 support are both missing/not added yet. It is a work in progress, and you may see bugs that were previously fixed. Please be patient as this is a work in progress.
Wine:
-Updated wine + wine-staging to 6.4-git
-Need For Speed atiadlxx fix ported from proton (Need For Speed now runs)
-Crown Trick + Home Behind 2 fix ported from proton
-Hades controller input fix ported from proton
-DualSense/PS5 controller mapping ported from proton
-Additional OpenXR patches ported from proton

-FAudio updated to git
-Wine and Wine-staging updated to git
-vkd3d updated to git
-dxvk updated to git and FarCry 5 texture issue worked around
-Dead or Alive 5 protonfix added (thanks iglu47)
-watchdogs 2 and farcry5 uplay overlay disable protonfixes added (thanks iglu47)
-corefonts fixed in protonfixes (thanks iglu47)
-vcrun2019_ge download url updated in protonfixes
-winetricks updated in protonfixes
-msiexec re-enabled in wine build (thanks fastrizwaan)

All in all, I would say the summary of this build is if you want to play MK11 or Injustice 2, this build is for you, but if you have any games that heavily relied on Media Foundation (mfplat) prior to this, chances are they may be broken in this build. Once Derek gets WMV and MP4S2 implemented along with some cleanups the next build should work nicely regarding mfplat.

Proton-6.1-GE-2

HOTFIX: 2/7/2021
-removed futex2 patches, they cause warframe's launcher to freeze.
Download link updated
Release notes:

-removed previous steam common redistributables fix for winetricks -- it was causing crashes on arch systems, and winetricks fixed the download urls upstream anyway. This should also fix some issues with games launching once then not launching again.
-updated winetricks in protonfixes
-added tree of savior d3dcompiler_47 override
-fixed crash issue in RE2 and Visage on vega APUs due to dxvk being compiled with gcc9 (resolved with gcc10)
-cyberpunk heap allocation/shared memory patches added, should improve performance
-additional spatial audio patches added from experimental
-futex2 patches added from experimental

Proton-6.1-GE-1

Hotfix #3: 2/1/2021

Since Microsoft decided to remove the download URLs for DirectX:

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/sha-1-windows-content-to-be-retired-august-3-2020/ba-p/1544373
https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/l79r4x/psa_microsoft_has_removed_directx_download_from/
https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/l7sax5/microsoft_removed_older_offline_directdownloads/

It broke some of the usual protonfixes/winetricks overrides -- such as d3dx11_43, d3dcompiler_43, xaudio, xactengine, vcrun2015/17/19 and a few others. Luckily for us, Valve ships most of these and it's auto-downloaded on most systems that run Windows or Proton games, under the 'Steamworks Common Redistributables' tool.

With that being said, I've added functionality to proton to detect this folder, and install the overrides from this folder, instead of having to download them from Microsoft. This should save both bandwidth and disk space.

Again, if you have issues with protontricks not being applied to the prefix, make sure you have 'Steamworks Common Redistributables' installed under the 'TOOLS' section of your library in steam.

Download updated.
Hotfix #2: 1/31/2021

-Persona 4 Golden sound actually fixed this time with xactengine3_7 override
-Persona 4 Golden protonfixes k-lite install fixed to use locally written config for unattended install instead of github download
(If this was an issue for you before, please try again with a clean prefix)
-Microsoft Flight Simulator crash on new flight loading fixed (needed missing wmphoto patches)

Download updated.

Hotfix: 1/31/2021

-Small hotfix which adds rebased patch for doitsujin/dxvk#1582. Allows it to be applied to upstream dxvk without reverting doitsujin/dxvk@2d670ec and doitsujin/dxvk@c107345. Not a major change, but not reverting them fixes some validation errors per the commit comment. Download updated.
Updates:

-Persona 4 Golden in-game audio fixed, game should now be fully playable
-Cyberpunk 2077 issue resolved where FPS would be half of that experienced in regular proton (Thanks TKG for finding the dxgi override which resolved it)
-fsync issue causing conhost to pin 1 cpu at 100% resolved (thanks openglfreak Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git@ddd28ce)
-controller hotplugging fixes imported from proton experimental for Subnautica and DOOM 2016
-Yakuza like a dragon controller detection fix imported from proton experimental
-Warframe controller workaround functionality updated
-dxvk updated
-vkd3d updated
-faudio updated
-wine + wine-staging updated
A note about Warframe controller functionality:

The issue with Warframe via Steam Play/Proton as many people know is that if you do not have a controller plugged in, the game would crash after 5 minutes on the dot. The workaround for this was to run xboxdrv to create a fake controller. About a year ago I created a patch for steamclient that worked around this issue by checking the names of joystick devices (js0,1,2 etc) in /dev/input/. This -sort of- worked. The reason I say sort of, is because some non-gamepad devices such as corsair mice and keyboards register themselves as joysticks.

So the trick was to check the name for anything that didn't have 'keyboard' or 'mouse' in the name. This however, did not work, as other devices such as steering wheels and flight controllers also got passed as 'gamepads'. Since steering wheels and flight controllers are not used in Warframe.. this again led to the crash.

I've now edited the patch again, this time steamclient's controller interface (which causes the crash), will not load in Warframe unless the device name contains 'controller' or 'pad'. I tested this with xbox, ps4, switch, and logitech controllers, as well as off-brand controllers, both wired, bluetooth, and ms xbox wireless, all were recognized ok, and the interface did not load with my steering wheel or hotas flight stick.

The purpose of this patch is to allow Warframe to run -with out- needing xboxdrv, so that it will not crash. If you experience warframe crashing after 5 minutes on the dot, please let me know, as I'd like to know more about your joystick devices in /dev/input and possibly add an exception if needed.

Please keep in mind this detection system only affects Warframe. Outside of Warframe controllers and other devices will act as they would normally in Valve's proton.
A note about Skyrim SE Script Extender (skse64):

The patch for SKSE has been removed, per:

https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44893#c17

The author of SKSE admitted a bug in skse and and fixed it upstream in skse:

--- quote ---
I reached out to the SKSE team about this and Ian Patterson confirmed that there
had been a bug with calculating the minimum safe address and corrected it in
F4SE, but somehow it was not corrected for SKSE.
--- quote ---

This has since been fixed here:

ianpatt/skse64@4a1e121

However a new version of SKSE has not been released yet so the fix is not in it. The fix was added Dec 28 but the current SKSE build available at https://skse.silverlock.org/ is from August.

I've recompiled it and supplied it here (with sources) until the Author releases a new version:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I6tgvZDaSs2JPXkHdWJwuZVwzF0OSpzz/view?usp=sharing

Seems to work for me. Game launches and my mods work. If a specific mod doesn't work but others do it's likely an issue with that mod specifically more so than SKSE. Please note I'm providing this to get mods working for the majority of people without needing patching, and -not- responsible if any specific single mod does not work. The latest version of SkyUI seems to work here for me.
Known issues:

-The build uses proton's new runtime, which runs within a container, therefore all of the current Proton 5.13 issues also apply here.

-MK11 Story mode and Cinematics do not work
-Injustice 2 Cinematics do not work

Proton-5.11-GE-2-MF

GloriousEggroll released this Jun 29, 2020

This is a minor hotfix/stability release:

-Fixed issue with steam overlay causing mouse lag after 30+ minutes (issue present since 5.9, was missing from rawinput patches)
-Fixed issue with mouse hitting 'invisible walls' (issue present since 5.9, was missing from rawinput patches)
-Fixed issue with prefixes not generating properly causing some games not to be able to save due to the recent user name changes
-Ashes of the Singularity now works, vulkan renderer does not. Need to use DX11/12
-Jurassic World: Evolution now works

NOTE: If you want to allow your save games to work when using proton within lutris, you need to set WINEUSERNAME environment variable
NOTE: If you want proton's media foundation to work in lutris, you need to set GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0 and WINE_GST_REGISTRY_DIR environment variables.


Proton-5.11-GE-1-MF

GloriousEggroll released this Jun 26, 2020

Game fixes:
-Origin 5.11 hang fixed
-Origin fixes ported from Proton 5.0.9
-Path of Exile Vulkan Renderer in-game swap fixed (for radv you will need mesa-git for upstream graphical glitch fixes)
-StarCitizen hang fixed
-Divinity Original Sin 2 hang fixed
-Mount and Blade: Bannerlord launcher fix added
-Persona 4 protonfixes fixed (thanks Pobega)
-Warframe launcher download hang fixed (broke in 5.10, still does not show progress bar)
-Sea of Thieves proper websockets implementation patches added (no longer needs win7)
-Partial fix for Catherine -- game now opens and can reach menus. Hangs on new game, waiting on EVR implementation in wine
-Deep Rock Galactic (and other games) libffi dependency fixed that was causing various crashes -- note, please do not use steam-native if you are on arch, steam-runtime should always be used.
-Protonfixes added for Assetto Corsa, should now work OOTB

Build additions:
-'wmp9_x86_64' winetricks verb imported to protonfixes from upstream winetricks that allows wmp9 to be installed in 64 bit prefixes
-hotfix added to use normal username instead of 'steamuser' when run with non-steam games. This also seems to fix issues with origin and other platforms not being able to save game (such as running Jedi Fallen Order origin version in lutris with proton)
-vkd3d updated
-dxvk updated
-FAudio updated

Build removals:
-Temporary removal of fshack, currently breaks MK11
-Temporary removal of esync, 5.10+ did a large rework of ntdll which broke compatibility with esync. The patchset needs to be rebased. It is currently disabled in staging.
-Temporary removal of fsync - fsync relies on esync. No esync = no fsync.

Known issues but playable:
-MK11 - no audio in custscenes -- needs SAR fixes, online matches broken
-Injustice 2 - no audio in custscenes -- needs SAR fixes
-Broken sound in Borderlands 3 Marcus new game intro -- can be skipped.
-Age of Empires II WMV videos don't play
-Street Fighter V intro videos don't play

Still broken:
-Seven (hangs on new game)
-Catherine (hangs on new game)
-Soul Calibur VI (hangs at main menu, needs SAR fixes)
-Nioh videos don't play, gameplay untested

Marking this as release as it has a lot of regression fixes and should be quite stable, despite the ongoing media foundation work and esync/fsync being disabled.


Proton-5.9-GE-2-MF

GloriousEggroll released this Jun 06, 2020

--HOTFIX--
6/10/2020 7:17 PM MST:
After reviewing the issue tracker again for Sea of Thieves I found via ga2mer's comments that it becomes working/playable after login if the prefix is set to Win7. I tested this and it did indeed allow me to login and get past the previous journal issue/became playable. I've added a hotfix in protonfixes that should do this automagically. Updated Proton-5.9-GE-2-MF.tar.gz again.
--HOTFIX--
6/10/2020 10:15 AM MST:
I accidentally applied part 1 of a 2 part patch for RE3 twice instead of both 1st and 2nd parts, so I just corrected that and recompiled + reattached Proton-5.9-GE-2-MF.tar.gz. RE3 credits should work now

Hi all, I'm marking this as another pre-release as we still have some audio issues with media foundation, and a few other pending issues, however we also have quite a few fixes:

-Fullscreen hack is disabled still for compatibility with MK11.
-Rawinput re-enabled
-Nier/sekiro winex11 patch re-enabled
-winevulkan patches re-enabled
-The weird Skyrim mouse reverse input issue was fixed in 5.10, so I've backported it.
-There is some heavy work being done on wined3d and dxgi, which causes some additional issues, so TOXIKK and Killer Instinct require wined3d to currently run properly. Protonfixes have been added to do that automatically, so those games both work with wined3d currently.
-There is also some heavy work being done on ntdll in 5.10+, which cause esync and fsync patchsets to not be compatible. Due to this, I'm currently working with 5.9 and backporting specific changes necessary to retain esync and fsync compatibility.
-A dxgi native override was also added in protonfixes so that Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain now works
-A fix has been added for the RE3 credits crash - thanks vitorhnn!
-A fix has been added for the MK11 and Injustice 2 video color issue - thanks vitorhnn!
-A partial fix for websockets has been added for Sea of Thieves so that login now works, however it is currently crashing after login on 'Opening the Journal' - thanks ga2mer!
-5.10 media foundation patches have been backported
-Remi Bernon's free range memory allocation patches have been backported which increases performance in We Happy Few and some other games.
-Proton 5.0.8 changes backported
-DXVK updated
-vkd3d updated
-FAudio updated

Known issues:
-Fullscreen hack still disabled for the time being to retain compatiblity with MK11
-Path of Exile cannot switch to vulkan renderer when using RADV, but works with AMDVLK. This is something else tied to fullscreen hack, as patching in fullscreen hack allows it to switch. RADV currently has a lot of graphical glitches with PoE anyway, so for the time being AMDVLK is the better option to use.
-Soul Calibur VI still hangs at intro due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation
-Injustice 2 and MK11 cut scene audio is missing due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation
-Borderlands 3 Marcus intro on new game audio is distorted due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation, but is skippable.
-Seven still only plays intro audio, no video, and crashes after starting new game due to incomplete SAR work in media foundation.
-libffi6 is still needed for some rolling release distros such as arch
-As mentioned, due to work being done with wined3d, dxgi is in an odd state. If a game works in proton, but does not work in proton-ge, try adding WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dxgi=n %command% to the options. If it works, let me know and I can add a protonfixes override for it.

Currently I would say this should be ok to use for most games except Soul Calibur VI and Seven


Proton-5.9-GE-1-NR

GloriousEggroll released this on May 28, 2020

-Fullscreen hack was found to be the cause of Mortal Kombat 11 not working. This also requires a few other patches to be disabled such as some additional vulkan patches and raw input, as well as the Sekiro patch. Fullscreen hack used to work with this game, so this is just a temporary disable until I can figure out what in the patchset is causing MK11 to not work.
-Spyro audio is fully working now
-BL3 Markus intro has audio issues still but is skippable
-Soul Calibur VI freezes at the intro screen currently due to an issue with SAR audio.
-Seven actually launches now. Audio for intro movie plays but shows black screen. New game results in crash, again due to SAR audio.
-PC Building Simulator no longer freezes when running 3dmark on low settings. It just skips the video.


Proton-5.8-GE-2-MF

GloriousEggroll released this on May 13, 2020

This is an update to 5.8-GE-1 in regards to media foundation work:

Completed:
-RE3: Bathroom scene fixed
-Dangonronpa v3 fixed
-Power Rangers Battle for the grid chipmunk voices fixed
-Monster Hunter World tutorial movies fixed
-Super Lucky's Tale -- Fixed an issue with bink videos not playing in GE builds which work in proton

WIP (work in progress):
Borderlands 3 Marcus intro video
Darksiders Warmastered Edition opening videos play now play, but New Game movie crashes
Street Fighter V intro videos don't play
Seven intro videos don't play

Todo:
-Age of Empires II WMV videos don't play - check if MF or quartz
-Catherine Classic does not play, opens small black box for game window - check if MF or quartz
-Nioh videos don't play - check if MF or quartz


Proton-5.8-GE-1-MF

GloriousEggroll released this May 10, 2020

Overall fixes:
-Fix for ValveSoftware#2929 added, fixes crash in Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Nier: Automata
-GTA IV should be fully playable now, patches imported from upstream proton
-Street Fighter V should be fully playable now, patches imported from upstream proton

-Crazy Machines 3 videos fixed, should now be fully playable


Proton-5.6-GE-2

GloriousEggroll released this Apr 14, 2020

-This is a hotfix that reverts the fullscreen hack changes, as they introduced a regression with mouse stutter on movement after a period of time. What this means:
-Fullscreen hack is still enabled, it's just using proton's version, not customized for staging
-Staging's winex11.drv-mouse-coorrds and rawinput patchsets have been disabled
-Proton's rawinput patchset has been re-enabled.

Normally I'd wait to release smaller changes like this, but the regression made some games basically unplayable. This should allow games to be played at least without the mouse stutter.


Proton-5.6-GE-1

GloriousEggroll released this Apr 13, 2020

This is a pre-release continuation of the mfplat work done by Guy1524 (Derek) along with some additional fixes.

Wine + Wine-staging:
-Update to 5.6 release

mfplat:
-Add partial WMV playback support (Should allow RE2 and RE3 movies to play)
-Add gst-plugins-ugly and wmv playback patch to build

protonfixes:
-Add dxgi=n override for Darksiders Warmastered Edition, game seems to crash with wine's dxgi when using dxvk
-Add Divinity Original Sin 2 symlink fix update - fixes black screen on first launch
-Add SECCOMP override for RE3, needed by Denuvo
-Add SECCOMP override for DOOM Eternal, needed by Denuvo

proton:
-Add Proton 5.0.6 alpha patches
-Add Proton 5.0.6 alpha DOOM Eternal Audio patches
-fixed build system to include dist folder directly instead of tarball. This fixes the issue with sometimes having to hit the play button twice, or some issues people have on their system where the dist tarball never extracts.
-fullscreen hack patches modified to work with staging's winex11.drv-mouse-coorrds and rawinput patch sets

Notes:
-Spyro is still broken
-MHW Tutorials are still broken
-BL3 usually wants to set Direct12, which crashes. This generally leads to a popup asking you to restore default settings (confirm/hit yes). You will then need to relaunch the game and go in the games settings and change it to DirectX11 manually. After that DirectX11 should stick as the default mode.
-RE2 Crashes in DX12 with vkd3d at main menu, you'll need to set DirectX11 in re2_config.ini for DX11 with DXVK
-RE3 Seems to work with DX12 and vkd3d with minor interface graphical glitches. Can set DirectX11 in re3_config.ini for DX11 with DXVK
-FFXV seems to be working again

Again, I must note that 'pre-release' builds are basically alpha-testing builds. While they may contain a lot of fixes, some things may also be broken that normally are not.

Specifically in this regard - proton normally disables 'mfplay' which allows media foundation movies in many games (WMV and MP4) to just be skipped automatically. Since we enable this without full functionality, some games, such as Spyro or MHW, may hang when a movie tries to play.

If you wish to re-disable media foundation to use this version with your other games, you can use WINEDLLOVERRIDES=mfplay=n %command% in the game's launch options.


Proton-5.5-GE-1

GloriousEggroll released this Apr 5, 2020

So I'd like to preface that this is a pre-release that has a massive amount of media foundation/mfplat wine patches. A huge thank you goes to Derek Lesho (Guy1524: https://github.com/Guy1524/wine) as well as Nikolay Sivov and Sergio Gómez Del Real all from CodeWeavers for getting this stuff working and taking the time to help me get it working with the correct dependencies in proton.

What this does is allows mp4 playback in MANY titles, including UE4 -and- Unity engine games. This fixes a lot (not all, but a lot) of issues surrounding media foundation/mfplat without the need for the 'mf-install' workaround that has legal issues and limitations, and is much safer for us to ship.

Tested fixes:
-Fixed borderlands 3 lilith in-head videos and 'watch the monitor' video bug
-Fixes Remnant: From the Ashes intro videos, intro menu, character menu
-Fixes intro video on Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night
-Fixes mp4 playback issues related to Crazy Machines 3

Still broken:
-Borderlands 3 intro narrative with Marcus's voice on new game does not play
-Spyro is still broken
-Probably some other mp4 related titles

Additional updates:
-A small patch has been added that should fix sunset overdrive from crashing on launch: https://source.winehq.org/patches/data/182631
-Two warframe launcher regressions have been fixed
-Mouse input fix patches which were added to wine-staging for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36873
-Lots of gstreamer plugin related work has been done/added in order to get media foundation stuff working. This was also cleared with aeikum and kisak from Valve personally, and deemed -ok- to include in my repository. This means it is safe to continue to link in Valve's issue trackers, unlike the 'mf-install' workaround. HURRAY!

Additional notes:
-Not -all- mp4s are fixed. There are still some that have problematic formats that are being worked on.
-Also coming down the pipe soon will be WMV playback fixes. This is to be handled after the mp4 issues are sorted.

Enjoy!


Proton-5.4-GE-3

GloriousEggroll released this Mar 25, 2020

Proton-5.4-GE-2

GloriousEggroll released this Mar 22, 2020

This is more of a clean-up release although some new stuff/fixes have been added, mainly for DOOM Eternal

-Updated wine + staging to 5.4-git/upstream for DOOM Eternal
-Added ValveSoftware/wine#85 VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2 and fake support for VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive for DOOM Eternal
-Added ValveSoftware/wine#83 which fixes some crashes in DARK SOULS III (374320), Nier: Automata (524220), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (814380)
-Added some missing registry entries that prevented Batman: Arkham Knight from starting on a clean prefix
-Cleaned up/removed unused mf_install verb in protonfixes in preparation for newer mfplat alpha patches (coming soon)
-Removed '-wolcen lords of mayhem 'blob head' fix' as the game devs fixed it internally per update 1.0.10.0
-Removed 'plasma systray fix' as it didn't really benefit anything, and actually interfered with some games.
-Removed Detroit:Become Human patch as it's already been upstreamed
-Cleaned up some duplicate patches and updated our current patches to work with latest wine-git+staging/git
-Updated vkd3d
-Updated dxvk
-Updated FAudio

Notes on DOOM Eternal:

    DOOM Eternal currently requires vulkan-loader/vulkan-icd-loader 1.2.135
    For AMD also requires mesa-git .
    ACO did not work for me with DOOM Eternal when I tried it, but llvm worked fine.
    To get rid of pre-launch GPU notices such as (HDR not supported), open DOOMEternal/launcherData/launcher.cfg and change all of these to 0:

rgl_showAMDStartupWarning 0
rgl_showIntelStartupWarning 0
rgl_showNvidiaStartupWarning 0

GloriousEggroll released this Feb 19, 2020

Proton-5.1-GE-2

GloriousEggroll released this Feb 17, 2020

This is mainly a hotfix + feature release build.

Hotfix:
-Fixed warframe requiring a controller to be plugged in. That's right, you no longer need xboxdrv! I spent the weekend debugging it and was finally able to come up with a bit of a hacky workaround, but it works for now until valve addresses the issue (it has to do with the way lsteamclient handles controllers)

Feature:
-vkd3d branch is latest from codeweavers + DXIL changes by Hans Kristian (who has been doing a lot of vkd3d submissions) + metro exodus commits that both Hans and Doitsujin (creator of dxvk) have been working on together. The previous release had Hans's DXIL changes, this just adds the Metro changes on top of it. With that being said, expect some minor graphical glitches in vkd3d with Metro Exodus

Additions:
-This commit: ValveSoftware#3518 has been merged. This was a previous open PR from Guy1542, but it had a bug that would cause clustertruck and a few others not to launch. The new PR is by joshie (d9vk dev) and works now

-dxvk update to latest git
-faudio updated to latest git

Known issues:
-Just Cause 3 not able to save
-Batman Arkham Knight grappling hook not working
-MK11 hanging at launch (again)
